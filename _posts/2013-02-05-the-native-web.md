title: The Native Web
---

I love the web. And I love my mobile phone. I love that there are tools that
allow me to write smart phone applications using the technologies I
love.

HTML, JS, and CSS do a darn good job of
allowing me to quickly prototype and try new ideas. Because of this, I
hardly ever resort to any other implementation stack when writing an
app. Why write something complicated in XCode or Java when it's so easy
to get something up and running in the browser?

Other developers agree. Use web technologies and not only do you get a
familiar development workflow; you get portability. That's right. Write
once, run (almost) everywhere.

Now, I, myself have done quite a bit of research in getting some of the
common interaction/animation patterns so often employed on mobile apps
to work in HTML, CSS, and JS. There's the rub. That is no easy task. The
web just hasn't caught up with the performance native development can
provide. In fact, if he knows what to
look for, a developer can spot the different between a web app pretending to be
native, and one that has actually been written for that
specific device (in Object C, Java, etc.).

There's a ton of discussion and effort going into improving the web and
turning it into the premiere app development platform. Companies
everywhere are pooling there resources and devoting themselves to
forwarding web standards for this purpose (my employer included).

I love that. I think there are some huge gaps in the web that could
be filled through this process. But I strongly disagree with the notion
of improving the web for app development.

Let's look at an ideal world here. Web developers create rich, beautiful
experience that can run in a browser using high-performant Javascript
and HTML and CSS that makes it all seamless. They are passionate about
the web and the tools that allow them to create these wonderful sites.
In this ideal world they can also use the languages they know and love
to write great mobile applications. 

This is the world we're striving for. This is the goal that has brought
about things like PhoneGap and Sencha. Developers have begun taking
advantage of webviews and making them appear to be native applications.
Seems pretty sweet right?

```
HTML + JS + CSS = iPhone + Android + WP + Mac + Windows + Linux
```

Only problem is the developers and their customers have complaints about
performance.
