I'm presenting at [jQuery Conference in San Diego](http://events.jquery.com/2014/san-diego) this afternoon.
This talk is an adaptation from a [previous blog post](http://tybenz.com/post/widgetize-all-the-things) 
about resuable UI components in JavaScript. Slides are posted here:

Also, I'm releasing this small open-source UI component library as part of the talk, called **lego.js**.
It's really just meant to be a repository of more in-depth code samples of the kind of components
presented in the talk. Feel free to check it out:
