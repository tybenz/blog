I'm presenting at [jQuery Europe](http://gentics.com/jquery-europe) today. The
talk is an adaptation from a [previous blog
post](http://tybenz.com/post/widgetize-all-the-things) about resuable UI
components in JavaScript.

Live stream here: http://gentics.com/jquery-europe

Slides are posted here: http://tybenz.com/presentation-js-legos

Also, I'm releasing this small open-source UI component library as part of the talk, called **lego.js**.
It's really just meant to be a repository of more in-depth code samples of the kind of components
presented in the talk. Feel free to check it out:
