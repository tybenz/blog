I finally decided to get serious about writing an HTML5 game a few
months back. It's been a blast and one heck of a learning experience.
A couple weeks into it, we started to keep a hacker journal on all of the
problems we came across and how we chose to solve them.

You can click the link below and find all kinds of stuff from nailing
down artificial intelligence to performance tweaks to information about
custom tools we made along the way.
