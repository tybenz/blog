            <p>I thought I&#39;d write a quick post about what I used to create this blog.</p>

<ol>
<li>Jekyll: Static site generator</li>
<li>Sass: CSS preprocessor</li>
<li>Bourbon: Set of generic Sass mixins</li>
<li>Neat: Set of grid-based Sass mixins (dependent on Bourbon)</li>
<li>Fonts: Bebas Neue, Adobe Source Sans Pro, Adobe Source Code Pro</li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#39;re not using Github Pages and Jekyll yet, get cracking. There is
nothing I love more than to write a post in markdown, deploy it with
git, and have the whole thing hosted for free!</p>

<p>Sass just makes life better. There are far too many vendor prefixes to
deal with these days. And Sass makes styling quick and painless.</p>

<p>Bourbon and Neat are my new favorite mixin library. The guys at
Thoughtbot are always doing some great things, but this small, intuitive
mixin and grid system just works.</p>

<p>The Adobe fonts have become my new favorite defaults. Bebas is just a
great headings fault, similar to din. I&#39;m in love.</p>

<p>Well that about wraps it up. The list is pretty short and I&#39;m extremely
happy with the results. Thanks for reading.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been using Gists a lot recently to pass code back and forth between
myself and my co-workers, and I&#39;m starting to realize more and more how
valuable good code snippets can be. I find myself perusing Github all
the time to see what other people are working on and half the time I
stumble upon some small, reusable piece of code that I force myself to
grab and dump into my own little directory of code snippets.</p>

<p>The more and more I collect, the more I realize the process of finding
good code snippets on the web is pretty terrible. I often just hit
google and wind up on stack overflow, having to sift through a bunch of
people&#39;s ramblings and log files and whatnot. Why isn&#39;t there a better
place to search for these small bits of wonder-code?</p>

<p>I set out to see if it already existed, and it turns out that it
doesn&#39;t. So I plan on creating one. </p>

<h5 id="toc_0">Side Story</h5>

<p>My sister-in-law went into labor last week so my wife and I
went down to Lemoore Naval Air Station to see the baby. As I was driving
off the base I saw a sign indicating which way to turn to get to the
Armory. That&#39;s when it hit me. This code snippet site need not only
focus on code snippets. I want to make it a place where developers get
equipped in every way they need.</p>

<h5 id="toc_1">The Plan</h5>

<p>Offer the soliders (developers) a chance to stock up on weapons
(snippets), load up on ammo (frameworks/libraries), engage in training
(walkthroughs) and choose their
barracks (development environments). The latter will most likely allow
for users to peruse various <a href="http://vagrantup.com">vagrant</a> boxes and
associated chef recipes (if you don&#39;t know about vagrant, get it).</p>

<h5 id="toc_2">Implementation</h5>

<p>Like I said I love Gists. Rather than re-inventing the wheel 
this new project is simply going to
leverage gists. I&#39;ll add some meta-data to various gists to create a place
where code snippets can be searched and saved more easily.</p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t Github added this to Gist already? My bet is they&#39;ve been
busy. You know, redefining how everyone codes? They might
get around to improving Gist, but for now, I&#39;m taking it upon myself.
Who&#39;s with me?</p>

<h5 id="toc_3">I Need Help</h5>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but this sounds like a dream to me. But I&#39;m
going to need help in getting some solid content onto this site. If you
can help spread the word, or send me some code snippets you&#39;ve found to
be invaluable, it would go a long way toward getting this project off
the ground.</p>

          <div class="post-header">
                <p class="date">Jul 24, 2012</p>
                <h1><a href="/post/themebot">ThemeBot</a></h1>
          </div>
          <div class="post-body">
            <p>Working on ThemeRoller was a lot of fun and it taught me a lot about client-side styling and user interfaces in general.
It has also stood out in my mind as I continue to interact with more and more CSS frameworks, and I keep longing for more
tools like ThemeRoller.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line with ThemeRoller, someone asked me, &quot;Why is this tool specific to one framework?
Couldn&#39;t you create a tool that would work with any CSS file?&quot;. My immediate reaction was that this
person clearly didn&#39;t understand the complexity of the problem (turns out, it&#39;s not that complex at all).</p>

<p>But the thing is, even after wrapping up my involvement with jQuery Mobile, that person&#39;s question was still echoing in
the back of my mind. Would it be that hard to develop some framework-agnostic, WYSIWYG theme creation tool?</p>

<p>My immediate thought was to improve upon current developer tools. We all know Firebug and Chrome&#39;s developer tools work 
just fine for debugging and quick styling, but I think the app I have in mind would do more for non-developers
beginning to dabble in some frameworks like jQuery Mobile or Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I could potentially put a little time and effort into forking/extending a tool like Firebug and adding some nice color
pickers and number spinners, but at the end of the day it wouldn&#39;t reach as many people or be all that usable.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s my thought. I want to create an extensible and configurable theming application that any developer can
grab, tweak, and apply for his specific framework. This way, each framework could potentially have it&#39;s own
customized version of the tool, but at the end of the day the basic ingredients are all the same.</p>

<p>What are those ingredients? Glad you asked:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fast, light-weight parsing of any CSS file</li>
<li>UI elements specialized towards various CSS rules</li>
<li>Colorpicker</li>
<li>An inspector tool for point and click edits</li>
<li>Draggable colors with customizable behaviors</li>
<li>Undo/Redo Logs of every action the user makes</li>
<li>Downloadable/Shareable themes</li>
</ol>

<p>As far as parsing goes, for now I&#39;m thinking that the API will mostly handle the business logic of the actual skinning.
But the rules that a user has access to will need to be specified by the developer. This can be done with some esoteric CSS
comment for every rule that needs to be represented in the UI. Or, more likely, some specific JSON that the developer could write
out quickly that would list which rules are editable, and how they are grouped.</p>

<p>The potential for this app extends beyond just the big-name frameworks. The tool could also be used when designing a site
for a client. I&#39;ll give you a scenario. You whip up a site design, and your client is unhappy with your choice of typeface,
color, spacing, etc, but he likes the overall layout. Why bother iterating on color choices? Design a solid layout, and then let
the clients skin the page themselves. All you do is provide a base theme that can be easily tweaked. Sounds nice right? </p>

<p>Ok, so there&#39;s the overall outline. I&#39;d love to get some feedback on the idea, as well as any questions/suggestions you
might have about implementing this thing. Give me a shout-out on <a href="http://twitter.com/tybenz">Twitter</a>, <a href="mailto:tabenziger@gmail.com">email</a> me or submit a ticket on the <a href="https://github.com/tybenz/themebot">github</a>.</p>

<p>Note: This project is nothing more than a thought for now, so no, there&#39;s no source code to look at. Check back later for
updates. It will be soon.</p>
