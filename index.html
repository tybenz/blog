            I've been experiencing a lot of newness in my life recently. I'm new to fatherhood, working in the software industry,
            contributing to open source, as well as a whole slew of technologies that I've had the chance to work with.
            Here's a breakdown of what's been going on with me.

            My son was born on February 2, 2012. His name is <a href="http://awes0.me/brody.jpg">Brody</a> and he makes life wonderful, frustrating, and super fun all
            at the same time. Parenthood has, hands down, been the most life-changing thing. I can't even describe how cool it is.
            Just go make a baby, and you'll see what I mean. As a side note, I'd recommend marriage first. You're going to need help.

            I started an internship with Adobe in the summer of 2011 and I've worked for them ever since.
            Working there has given me so many great opportunities and I know it will continue to be a place of great value to me.

            In my spare time I enjoy building extensible tools from the ground-up. Even if no one ends up using it, I know it makes me write better
            code. Something with which I'm also OBSESSED.

            My first project at Adobe was jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller. This was a Javascript-intensive project, and I quickly figured out
            that programming in Javascript is a lot easier when you have a deeper understanding of how the language is implemented.
            This is, of course, the case with all programming languages.

            I've since stumbled onto Rails and consequently Ruby. I'm constantly trying to improve my UNIX/Bash skills. I love perusing
            Github for helpful/inventive tools to help with JS or Ruby development.
