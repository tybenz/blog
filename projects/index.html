        A small utility for quickly adding files to a Github repo.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted a way to quickly add pictures to a GitHub Page. So I wrote a shell script that lets me quickly
        add a file to a repo, push to a remote, and copy the URL into my clipboard for quick sharing. I then wrapped
        this script in a Mac App so it's "droppable".
    </p>
    <p>
        I've found it incredibly useful. In fact, I modified this script
        to allow me to quickly add new posts to my blog and automatically tweet about them.
        Check out the GitDrop home page to read more about it ( <a href="http://tybenz.github.com/gitdrop">here</a> ).

    <p>
        A jQuery Plugin for autonomous template injection (For use with Rails UJS Ajax calls)
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As I began to experiment with Rails more and more, I noticed a <a href="/post/welcome">pattern</a> when making
        CRUD calls via AJAX. Adding things to the database often involved appending some new set of markup to my
        document on the clientside. So I wrote AjaxAppend. It leverages HTML templating and the Rails "ajax:sucess" event
        to automatically use JSON from an XHR response to create and append some set of markup.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I realize that this plugin doesn't have to be Rails-specific. The next thing on my list is to allow for AjaxAppend
        to work with any event and bind to the success method of any ajax call.

    <p>
        An HTML5 game with blocks, boats, and bots
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I found myself constantly doodling the same character over and over. I called him block man (he was often sketched on
        graph paper), and I started sketching other types of critters and objects in a similar 9x9 grid. I sat down and stared at
        what I'd drawn and decided I wanted to make a game based off of these different shapes. First question was which of these
        shapes would be my protagonist? Answer: all of them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The game is based on a shape-shifter who can transform into different things and gain unique abilities in each form. I 
        chose the generic codename Morph and started sketching other objects/characters/enemies that would inhabit this virtual 2D
        world. Here's an early preview of the sprites that will be used in the game:

        Side note: I'm tentatively planning on making the game an platform-based open-world RPG. <a href="/contact">Thoughts</a>?

    <p>A grocery list app to organize recipes cross-referenced with the map/layout of a specific grocery store</p>
    
    <p>
        My wife and I have developed this weekly ritual where we sit down and choose which recipes we want to cook
        throughout the week. We then write up a shopping list based on what's missing from the pantry and head out
        to stock up for the week, only to end up walking the full-length of the grocery store confused as to which item
        to grab next (I'm aware this is a first world problem).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        So why all the confusion? The list is not sorted in a particular order. We simply went through each recipe and
        wrote down what we needed to make it. So I want to write an app where we can store our recipes, quickly select which ones
        we want for a shopping trip, and have it add all the items into a list sorted by location in the grocery store.
        This way we avoid all the wandering and we can get in and out of there fast.

    <p>
        A universal theming application for any CSS framework
    </p>
    
    <p>
        ThemeRoller for jQuery Mobile ended up having some cool features for theming jQm apps. I'd like to take what I did with
        ThemeRoller and write an app that can be easily configured to work with more than just one specific CSS framework.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For now I'm thinking to start by building a theming tool for a different CSS framework and porting over some of
        the TR UI elements to work more generically. I'll start with Twitter's Bootstrap, and see what I can learn about
        how to generalize the solution. You can bet I'll blog about what I find.
