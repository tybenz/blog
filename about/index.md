My name is Tyler Benziger. I am a web developer, father, and musician.

I work at Adobe in San Francisco on a small team that focuses on validating and prototyping new
ideas. The flexibility of my team has given me
some amazing opportunities including working on projects like [jQuery
Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com), [Muse](http://adobe.com/muse), and
[Rifff](http://rifff.com).

I have an amazing family, including my beautiful wife Amy, my one-year
old son, Brody, and a new baby on the way (ETA: October).

I've been playing music for about 10 years. I dabble in a lot of different
instruments but my true love is the elctric guitar. I've played with
some fellow musicians on a few different projects (mostly for fun), but
my heart is in worship. I am apart of music ministry at a church called
[Crossroads](http://crossroadsgrace.org) in Manteca, CA and it's
something about which I'm extremely passionate.

This is my blog where you'll find my rantings usually surrounding these
three topics.
